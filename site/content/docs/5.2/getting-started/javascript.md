## Individual or compiled

Plugins can be included individually (using Bootstrap's individual `js/dist/*.js`), or all at once using `bootstrap.js` or the minified `bootstrap.min.js` (don't include both).

If you use a bundler (Webpack, Rollup...), you can use `/js/dist/*.js` files which are UMD ready.

## Usage with JavaScript frameworks

While the Bootstrap CSS can be used with any framework, **the Bootstrap JavaScript is not fully compatible with JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular** which assume full knowledge of the DOM. Both Bootstrap and the framework may attempt to mutate the same DOM element, resulting in bugs like dropdowns that are stuck in the "open" position.

A better alternative for those using this type of frameworks is to use a framework-specific package **instead of** the Bootstrap JavaScript. Here are some of the most popular options:

- React: [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- Vue: [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/)
- Angular: [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/)

## Using Bootstrap as a module

We provide a version of Bootstrap built as `ESM` (`bootstrap.esm.js` and `bootstrap.esm.min.js`) which allows you to use Bootstrap as a module in your browser, if your [targeted browsers support it](https://caniuse.com/es6-module).

```html
<script type="module">
  import { Toast } from 'bootstrap.esm.min.js'

  Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.toast'))
    .forEach(toastNode => new Toast(toastNode))
</script>
```

## Incompatible plugins

Due to browser limitations, some of our plugins, namely Dropdown, Tooltip and Popover plugins, cannot be used in a `<script>` tag with `module` type because they depend on Popper. For more information about the issue see [here](https://v8.dev/features/modules#specifiers).
{{< /callout >}}

## Dependencies

Some plugins and CSS components depend on other plugins. If you include plugins individually, make sure to check for these dependencies in the docs.

Our dropdowns, popovers and tooltips also depend on [Popper](https://popper.js.org/).

## Data attributes

Nearly all Bootstrap plugins can be enabled and configured through HTML alone with data attributes (our preferred way of using JavaScript functionality). Be sure to **only use one set of data attributes on a single element** (e.g., you cannot trigger a tooltip and modal from the same button.)

Make sure to change the case type of the option name from camelCase to kebab-case when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use `data-bs-custom-class="beautifier"` instead of `data-bs-customClass="beautifier"`.

As of Bootstrap 5.2.0, all components support an **experimental** reserved data attribute `data-bs-config` that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has `data-bs-config='{"delay":0, "title":123}'` and `data-bs-title="456"` attributes, the final `title` value will be `456` and the separate data attributes will override values given on `data-bs-config`. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like `data-bs-delay='{"show":0,"hide":150}'`.

## Selectors

Currently, to query DOM elements we use the native methods `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` for performance reasons, so you have to use [valid selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier).
If you use special selectors, for example: `collapse:Example` be sure to escape them.
{{< /callout >}}

## Events

Bootstrap provides custom events for most plugins' unique actions. Generally, these come in an infinitive and past participle form - where the infinitive (ex. `show`) is triggered at the start of an event, and its past participle form (ex. `shown`) is triggered on the completion of an action.

All infinitive events provide [`preventDefault()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) functionality. This provides the ability to stop the execution of an action before it starts. Returning false from an event handler will also automatically call `preventDefault()`.

```js
const myModal = document.querySelector('#myModal')

myModal.addEventListener('show.bs.modal', event => {
  if (!data) {
    return event.preventDefault() // stops modal from being shown
  }
})
```


## Programmatic API

All constructors accept an optional options object or nothing (which initiates a plugin with its default behavior):

```js
const myModalEl = document.querySelector('#myModal')

const modal = new bootstrap.Modal(myModalEl) // initialized with defaults

const configObject = { keyboard: false }
const modal1 = new bootstrap.Modal(myModalEl, configObject) // initialized with no keyboard
```

If you'd like to get a particular plugin instance, each plugin exposes a `getInstance` method. In order to retrieve it directly from an element, do this: `bootstrap.Popover.getInstance(myPopoverEl)`.
This method will return `null` if an instance is not initiated over the requested element

Alternatively `getOrCreateInstance` can be used to get the instance associated with a DOM element, or create a new one in case it wasn't initialized. `bootstrap.Popover.getOrCreateInstance(myPopoverEl, configObject)`.
In case an instance wasn't initialized, it may accept and use an optional configuration object as second argument

### CSS selectors in constructors

All plugin constructors, and in addition methods `getInstance` & `getOrCreateInstance`, can accept as first argument, a DOM element or a valid [CSS selector](#selectors).

Currently, the element for the plugin is found by the `querySelector` method since our plugins support a single element only.

```js
const modal = new bootstrap.Modal('#myModal')
const dropdown = new bootstrap.Dropdown('[data-bs-toggle="dropdown"]')
const offcanvas = bootstrap.Offcanvas.getInstance('#myOffcanvas')
const alert = bootstrap.Alert.getOrCreateInstance('#myAlert')
```

### Asynchronous functions and transitions

All programmatic API methods are **asynchronous** and return to the caller once the transition is started, but **before it ends**.

In order to execute an action once the transition is complete, you can listen to the corresponding event.

```js
const myCollapseEl = document.querySelector('#myCollapse')

myCollapseEl.addEventListener('shown.bs.collapse', event => {
  // Action to execute once the collapsible area is expanded
})
```

In addition, a method call on a **transitioning component will be ignored**.

```js
const myCarouselEl = document.querySelector('#myCarousel')
const carousel = bootstrap.Carousel.getInstance(myCarouselEl) // Retrieve a Carousel instance

myCarouselEl.addEventListener('slid.bs.carousel', event => {
  carousel.to('2') // Will slide to the slide 2 as soon as the transition to slide 1 is finished
})

carousel.to('1') // Will start sliding to the slide 1 and returns to the caller
carousel.to('2') // !! Will be ignored, as the transition to the slide 1 is not finished !!
```

##### `dispose` method
Special care on `dispose` usage. It may seem right to use it directly after `hide()`, it will lead to wrong results

So the proper use would be something like:

```js

const myModal = document.querySelector('#myModal')
myModal.hide() // it is asynchronous

myModal.addEventListener('shown.bs.hidden', event => {
  myModal.dispose()
})
```
{{< /callout >}}

### Default settings

You can change the default settings for a plugin by modifying the plugin's `Constructor.Default` object:

```js
// changes default for the modal plugin's `keyboard` option to false
bootstrap.Modal.Default.keyboard = false
```

{{< /bs-table >}}

## Sanitizer

Tooltips and Popovers use our built-in sanitizer to sanitize options which accept HTML.

The default `allowList` value is the following:

```js
const ARIA_ATTRIBUTE_PATTERN = /^aria-[\w-]*$/i
const DefaultAllowlist = {
  // Global attributes allowed on any supplied element below.
  '*': ['class', 'dir', 'id', 'lang', 'role', ARIA_ATTRIBUTE_PATTERN],
  a: ['target', 'href', 'title', 'rel'],
  area: [],
  b: [],
  br: [],
  col: [],
  code: [],
  div: [],
  em: [],
  hr: [],
  h1: [],
  h2: [],
  h3: [],
  h4: [],
  h5: [],
  h6: [],
  i: [],
  img: ['src', 'srcset', 'alt', 'title', 'width', 'height'],
  li: [],
  ol: [],
  p: [],
  pre: [],
  s: [],
  small: [],
  span: [],
  sub: [],
  sup: [],
  strong: [],
  u: [],
  ul: []
}
```

If you want to add new values to this default `allowList` you can do the following:

```js
const myDefaultAllowList = bootstrap.Tooltip.Default.allowList

// To allow table elements
myDefaultAllowList.table = []

// To allow td elements and data-bs-option attributes on td elements
myDefaultAllowList.td = ['data-bs-option']

// You can push your custom regex to validate your attributes.
// Be careful about your regular expressions being too lax
const myCustomRegex = /^data-my-app-[\w-]+/
myDefaultAllowList['*'].push(myCustomRegex)
```

If you want to bypass our sanitizer because you prefer to use a dedicated library, for example [DOMPurify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify), you should do the following:

```js
const yourTooltipEl = document.querySelector('#yourTooltip')
const tooltip = new bootstrap.Tooltip(yourTooltipEl, {
  sanitizeFn(content) {
    return DOMPurify.sanitize(content)
  }
})
```


## Still want to use jQuery? It's possible!

Bootstrap 5 is designed to be used without jQuery, but it's still possible to use our components with jQuery.

**If Bootstrap detects `jQuery` in the `window` object**, it'll add all of our components in jQuery's plugin system;
this means you'll be able to do:

```js
$('[data-bs-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip() // to enable tooltips, with default configuration

$('[data-bs-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip({ boundary: 'clippingParents', customClass: 'myClass' }) // to initialize tooltips with given configuration

$('#myTooltip').tooltip('show') // to trigger `show` method

```

The same goes for our other components.

### No conflict (only if you use jQuery)

Sometimes it is necessary to use Bootstrap plugins with other UI frameworks. In these circumstances, namespace collisions can occasionally occur. If this happens, you may call `.noConflict` on the plugin you wish to revert the value of.

```js
const bootstrapButton = $.fn.button.noConflict() // return $.fn.button to previously assigned value
$.fn.bootstrapBtn = bootstrapButton // give $().bootstrapBtn the Bootstrap functionality
```

### jQuery events

Bootstrap will detect jQuery if `jQuery` is present in the `window` object and there is no `data-bs-no-jquery` attribute set on `<body>`. If jQuery is found, Bootstrap will emit events thanks to jQuery's event system. So if you want to listen to Bootstrap's events, you'll have to use the jQuery methods (`.on`, `.one`) instead of `addEventListener`.

```js
$('#myTab a').on('shown.bs.tab', () => {
  // do something...
})
```


## No special fallbacks when JavaScript is disabled

Bootstrap's plugins don't fall back particularly gracefully when JavaScript is disabled. If you care about the user experience in this case, use [`<noscript>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/noscript) to explain the situation (and how to re-enable JavaScript) to your users, and/or add your own custom fallbacks.

{{< callout warning >}}
##### Third-party libraries

**Bootstrap does not officially support third-party JavaScript libraries** like Prototype or jQuery UI. Despite `.noConflict` and namespaced events, there may be compatibility problems that you need to fix on your own.
